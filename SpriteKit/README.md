## Hitbox and hutbox

Hitboxes and hurtboxes are specialized collision checks (collision checks allow you to determine when objects come in contact or overlap). A hitbox is usually associated with some form of attack, and describes where that attack is effective. A hurtbox is usually associated with a character (or any other "hittable" object in your game). Whenever the two collide, we consider the attack to have "landed" and we apply its effect on the target.
